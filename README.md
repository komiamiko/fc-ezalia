# Ezalia
Brown focused level generator for [Fantastic Contraption](http://fantasticcontraption.com/original/).

Somewhat unusually, instead of targeting a normal Python package, Ezalia is compiled into a single self-contained Python file for easy distribution - `ezalia.py`.

## How to build

```py
compile.py
```

## How to run

```py
ezalia.py
```

## Common Python issues

Usually we can run a Python script from the command line like so:

```py
file.py
```

If the shebang doesn't work, try this:

```py
python3 -m file
```

or

```py
python3 file.py
```
